Today, I lead the UI efforts for one of America's largest insurance companies, working with technologies such as Angular 5, React and Node.js.</p><p>Throughout my career, I've seen the Web grow from simple static HTML websites into complex data-driven Progressive Web Apps. Over the years, I've invested countless hours honing my skills to stay on top of the next emerging technology trend. I'm not an expert at everything out there, but I'd be comfortable working in any tech stack, whether it be .NET, MEAN, React, or plain old vanilla JavaScript.</p>",
